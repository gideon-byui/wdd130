    <p>Hello! My name is Gideon from Accra, Ghana. I am currently an Ambassador at Skep Foundation 
      and I have been working in the non-profit organization for a year. 
      Previously, I worked as a Marketing Assistant for two years and as a course facilitator.
      I am a certified Technical Support Engineer, Digital marketer JavaScript and Web Developer. 
      My passion for technology led me to pursue the Technical Support Engineer Diploma Certificate 
      from Ensign College through BYU Pathway-Worldwide with an end goal of acquiring a Bachelor 
      of Science in Software Development.</p>
