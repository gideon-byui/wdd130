                Empowering Adventure Seekers to Conquer the Rapids, One Thrill at a Time has
                been the motive behing Big Whales Rafting since we started started operating in 1975, We offer rafting on 
                the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs, 
                Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood
                Canyon and beyond.
                
                Our journey started with a shared vision to introduce people to the exhilarating beauty and power of river adventures.
                 With nothing more than a few rafts and unwavering determination, we set out to conquer the roaring rapids of 
                 the Colorado Fork Rivers, our first playground. We pioneered the concept of guided water rafting expeditions in the 
                 region, 
                 taking participants on unforgettable journeys through breathtaking canyons, lush forests, and magnificent waterways.
                Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit, experienced 
                rafters. 
                No matter what type of river adventure you are seeking, Whitewater Rafting, LLC can make it happen for you!
                We strive to make your raft trip the very best of your life.
